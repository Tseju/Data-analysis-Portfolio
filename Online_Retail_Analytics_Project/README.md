# Online Retail Analytics Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Online Retail Analytics Project, a comprehensive analysis of sales data aimed at uncovering insights and trends in the retail industry. This project utilizes Power BI for data visualization and analysis, highlighting essential measures and cleaned data.

## Project Highlights
- **Objective:** This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to support data-driven decision-making.
- **Tools Used:** Power BI, and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating measures.
- **Data Source:** The dataset used for this analysis includes sales data, which has undergone data cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Data Cleaning
- **Quantity Check:** The dataset underwent a data cleaning process to ensure that the quantity of items sold is not below 1 unit.
- **Unit Price Check:** Another data cleaning step was implemented to confirm that the unit price is not below $0.

## Key Measures
